<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Goals
* Automatically apply MPT optimisation techniques to a range of investible factor ETFs, prescribing the 'optimal' portfolio, 
plotting, and reporting.
* Systematise positioning in the above optimal portfolio, taking into account current positioning and trading fees. 
* Generate accessible reporting, including performance and risk.
* Use the framework built for a more diverse trading system, where optimal portfolios or signals can be introduced as part
of an entire 'portfolio system'.
