<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Goals
* Automatically apply MPT optimisation techniques to a range of investible factor ETFs, trading the 'optimal' portfolio
* Generate accessible reporting, including performance and risk.
* Systematise portfolio positioning, intelligently accounting for current positioning and trading fees. 
* Build the framework in a reusable and extensible way, to later be part of a more diverse trading system, where optimal portfolios or signals can be introduced as part
of an entire 'portfolio system'.
